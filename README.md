# MiniSolver: High-Performance Nonlinear MPC Solver
This project, A solvers  for nonlinear optimal control and nonlinear model predictive control.
This project leverages AI(mainly Gemini) assistance for development with cursor, is architected and reviewed by Edward Qu.

MiniSolver is a blazing fast, header-only C++17 library for solving Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) problems. It is designed for embedded robotics applications where performance, robustness, and zero dynamic memory allocation are critical.
